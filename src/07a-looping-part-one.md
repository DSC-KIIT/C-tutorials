**Outline**

- What is this loop thingy ?
- A bit of history
- `goto` - Technically not a loop
- The `break` and `continue` statements
- `for` loops

## What is this loop thingy ?

- Loops repeat a block of code until a specified conition is met.
- Ada Lovelace first used a software loop to print out Bernoulli Numbers.
- They are of 3 kinds -
  1. `for` loop
  2. `while` loop
  3. `do while` loop

## `goto` - Technically not a loop

- It is a jump statement that allows us to transfer control of the program to a specified label.
- Avoid using goto for it leads to spaghetti code.
- That being said, goto statements aren't the problem rather their use in writing bad code is. As Donald Kunth put it, "Undisciplined `goto` statements make program structure harder to perceive."
