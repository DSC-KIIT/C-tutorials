This is a written version of the tutorial series on the **C Programming Language** available on the
youtube channel of DSC KIIT.


## Who is this for ?

This book is primarily targetted towards the incoming freshmen at KIIT who will be taking the **Introduction to Programming in C**
course mostly in their first or second semester. 

A lot of the times students who have not taken any Computer Science courses in  their +2 feel overwhelmed when they are introduced to the whole realm of programming. C being a low level language can often times be intimidating if not explained properly. This tutorial series and this document is an effort by DSC KIIT to help our juniors get started with C and eventually develop an interest in the various domains of Computer Science in general. 

We have tried our level best to keep the explanations as simple and as relatable as possible. We have followed a code first approach where most of the theoretical aspects of C are explained using code examples. We have tried to use modern tools so that it is easier for you to setup and get going. We have also explained some other more real world aspects of C such as using a debugger, working on large projects, using version control, using C for competitive programming etc. 

C is one of the oldest and most powerful languages out there and it is used to build a variety of cool things. Our hope here is that after going through our tutorials you will view C as more than just a subject that you have to study and pass your exams. Feel free to contact the authors for any further questions or concerns, we are always happy to help.
