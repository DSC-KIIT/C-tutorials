# Written Version of the C Tutorial Series

Live at https://bit.ly/dsckiit-c

This is a written version of the C Tutorial Series published on our youtube channel. You can recommend any changes you would like to see in the content. Feel free to open up a PR.

## Development

The content is written in Markdown and built using the [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) tool. Follow the install instructions on the README page of the mdbook repo. 

* To open the docs on `localhost:3000` run `mdbook open --serve`
* To trigger the build, run `mdbook build -d docs/`

Running the build command will put the html and css in the `docs/` directory for hosting on github pages.
