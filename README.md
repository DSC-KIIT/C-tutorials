# Written Version of the C Tutorial Series

The content is written in Markdown and built using the [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) tool. Follow the install instructions on the README page of the mdbook repo. 

By default the build content goes in the `book` directory, but a docs directory is created to serve over github pages.
