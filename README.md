# Written Version of the C Tutorial Series

Live at https://bit.ly/dsckiit-c

This is a written version of the C Tutorial Series published on our youtube channel. You can recommend any changes you would like to see in the content. Feel free to open up a PR.

## Development

The content is written in Markdown and built using the [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) tool. Follow the install instructions on the README page of the mdbook repo. 

By default the build content goes in the `book` directory, but a docs directory is created to serve over github pages.
